The goal of this project is to provide support for using electronic USB drum
kits designed for the Rock Band series of games as MIDI devices.

Currently only the Playstation 3 version of the Ion Drum Rocker peripheral is
supported. Support for other types of devices will be added when I can get my
hands on data describing how they talk over the USB bus (send me an email if
you have an unsupported device that you'd like to have supported).

The only currently supported platform is Linux (using ALSA). However, if you
have the need to support other platforms, additional output mechanism are easy
to write.


How to use:

Most devices pretend to be a normal HID (human interface device). However, they
somewhat abuse the HID protocol, so simply converting HID events to MIDI events
won't do the job.

The devices claiming to support HID causes the usbhid driver to attach to them.
Given that the devices don't really speak HID, the driver needs to unbind:

  echo $dev_id > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind
  ($dev_id is something like 3-1:1.0)

Now the device node can be accessed directly, you can run the 'rimshot' binary
you compiled using 'make'. You will need permission to read from and write to
the usb device nodes.
